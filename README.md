# Servo Tester

Control servos from web browser via Serial port. Works only with Chromium-based web-browsers. Tested on Arch Linux with Chromium `124.0.6367.118`. Maybe it works on windows.

# Setup
Upload sketch from `lowLevel` directory to your arduino, or use `arduino-cli` and Makefile(`make upload PORT=/dev/ttyUSBXXX`, change fqbn for your board).

You can open index.html in your **CHROMIUM**-based web-browser, or open github pages instance linked to this repo.
